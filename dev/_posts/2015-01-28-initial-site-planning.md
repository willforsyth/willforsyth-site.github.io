This is a step by step process on how to plan a site / app and how to gtaher the resources reate them and start to great intuitive wireframes through to prototypes.

### Step 1: Define the users
Take time to research into who the users, imagine you are coming to the application or site and what it is you want to acheive. How old are you where are you from whats your gender etc. These will help us to get into the mind of the user.

### Step 2: User stories
Define as many user stories as you can, As a _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ , I want to _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . This helps split our thinking into small bit size snippets of what the user is trying to acheive.

### Step 3: User Personnas
Pick several users from across the board and really start to think about who they are. Whats there name? Where do they live? What do they do for a living? what are they trying to complete on your application / site? If you really get your mind set things can start to appear that will give some really good insights into features for the site.

### Step 4: Gather resources
Now we have completed some user research, list all the features and resources that we have discovered that we need for the app. Rate the from most importatn to least important, this way if time is limited we can add things to the [MoSCoW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) methology. 

### Step 5: Define a sitemap
Now that we have defined and rated our resources, group them together and start to create a sitemap of hwo the content will be grouped and what pages and sections we will need.

### Step 6: Sketch out wireframes
This is where I start to sketch out roughly some page structures, with a higher archy of content and defining how the pages will be structure. Thinking about navigation and how the user will navigate sections. 

### Step 7: High definition wireframes and prototype
I then great high definition wireframes in illustrator and put togther a click through prototype in [MarvelApp](https://marvelapp.com/).
